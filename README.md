<h1><img src="https://github.com/tjf952.png" width="40"/> Wow, you found my Github! </h1>

<p style="font-size: 16px"> :grey_exclamation: So you found my hidden hole on the great big internet. I'm Thomas and I am trying my best to grow in knowledge about things from here and there. I graduated from University of Southern California with a degree in Computer Science and Computer Engineering back in 2019. I have also been playing with Capture the Flags and Hackathons since late highschool, but have just now realized that it would be a good idea to share all my knowledge (and find a place to put it all). Currently, I'm a tool developer and do a lot of programming in a wide variety of languages though I definitely prefer Python and Java. Anyhow, stay as long as you want and feel free to reach out to me. And remember: Let's all have fun and play together! </p>
